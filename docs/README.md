Daniel – Sales Manager

Subject: Internet Sales Dashboards

Hi James,

I hope you’re doing well.

We’re looking to enhance our internet sales reporting and move away from static reports towards interactive dashboards.

The dashboards should focus on sales performance by product and client, and how it has changed over time. Since each salesperson works with different products and customers, having the ability to filter by both would be really helpful.

We also track results against the budget, so I’ve attached the 2026 budget for comparison. Typically, we like to review sales for the past two years to spot trends.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or clarification.

Kind regards,
Daniel
